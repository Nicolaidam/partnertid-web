# Partnertid.dk — Vision & Product Strategy (Internal)

## Doc purpose
Unify the vision, product strategy, and key assumptions for Partnertid.dk + Partnertest.dk so we can start with a narrow niche, prove clear value, and then expand broadly.

## One-sentence promise
Weekly, structured check‑ins that strengthen relationships before problems arise — and make it fun to be intentional together.

## Vision
Make relationship maintenance as normal in Denmark as exercising, going to the dentist, or taking a vitamin pill.  
Partnertid becomes the weekly, proactive routine for couples who choose each other — without shame, without strangers, but with warmth, curiosity, and structure.

## Mission
Give couples a simple, safe, and enjoyable system for weekly check‑ins where they feel seen, heard, and connected — so they get better at talking about hard things before problems grow.

## Principles
- Proactive over reactive: start while things are good.
- Not therapy, but maintenance: guided structure between the two of you.
- Consistency beats intensity: 30–45 minutes weekly is enough.
- Trust and privacy are the foundation (anonymous, GDPR, EU servers).
- Light, warm, and human — ideally playful.

## Target users & niche strategy
We start narrow to create clear value, then expand.

Initial niche hypotheses (to validate):
- Couples together 2–7 years, age 28–38, busy life (career/children), who are “doing well” but want more closeness.
- Couples where one person (often the woman) initiates relationship work.
- Couples who are serious about each other and open to structure, but don’t want traditional couples therapy.

Strategy:
1) Choose one niche with strong pain + high motivation (based on test/landing data).
2) Design onboarding, tone, and prompts specifically for this group.
3) Document impact and retention → expand to the next adjacent segment.

## Value proposition & outcomes
Partnertid provides a safe space and a simple routine so couples can:
- Feel more seen and heard.
- Talk better about emotions and hard topics.
- Have fewer misunderstandings and more presence in daily life.
- Preserve and strengthen what already works.

Expected impact after 4–8 weeks:
- Higher felt connection.
- More safety in communication.
- An established weekly ritual rhythm.

## Product overview
The core is a weekly ritual routine:
1) Shared start: set intentions and common ground.
2) Individual reflection: guided questions each week.
3) Connecting insights: AI summarizes shared themes.
4) Guided conversation: “look each other in the eyes” with concrete prompts.
5) Consistency over time: small weekly steps → stronger relational muscle.

## Partnertest.dk → Partnertid.dk funnel
Two domains, one brand family:
- Partnertest.dk: a DISC‑inspired test that generates two “birds” (fun, light, valuable).
- Immediate value + shareability → email report.
- Email report introduces Partnertid.dk as the weekly routine that builds on test insights.
- Clear handoff: “You have your match — here is your weekly practice.”

## Business model & pricing
Subscription per couple, low price to become “a normal thing” in Denmark.
- Price target: 40–80 DKK/month (landing currently shows 69 DKK/month).
- First month free, no credit card during trial.
- Focus on high retention through ritual and felt value.

## Positioning & messaging
Core messages (inspired by landing):
- “It’s not therapy — it’s maintenance.”
- “Like a vitamin / training — a weekly routine.”
- “Start while things are good.”
- “For couples who choose each other.”
- “Safe, private, and anonymous.”

Tone: warm, non‑judgmental, everyday language, slightly playful.

## Trust, safety & privacy
- 100% anonymous and GDPR‑compliant.
- Data stored securely on EU servers.
- No external therapists read the content.
- The product must feel safe to use at home.

## Success metrics
- Conversion from Partnertest → Partnertid.
- Activation: first weekly check‑in completed.
- Week‑to‑week retention.
- Self‑reported impact: “feel more connected,” “talk better about hard things.”
- Referrals/organic sharing.

## Open questions & risks
- Which niche should we start with?
- “Therapy” vs “maintenance”: what sells best without creating the wrong expectations?
- Clinical/ethical boundary: what do we do for couples in crisis?
- Price elasticity and willingness‑to‑pay in Denmark.
- Risk of brand confusion between the test domain and the subscription.
